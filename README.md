# Cloud Foundations – Cost Management Assignment  
**Avion Christie – Stony Brook University**  
**HHA 504 — Cloud Foundations for Health Informatics**

This assignment compares billing, budgeting, and cost-forecasting features across Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I created budgets, configured alerts, explored cost dashboards, and captured evidence of forecasting and optimization tools.

## **Part 1 — Microsoft Azure**

### **1. Billing Overview**
Azure provides a summary of the billing scope, ownership, and active status.

### **2. Budget Creation**
I created an **$8 monthly budget** and added an **80% email alert threshold** based on actual cost.

### **3. Cost Analysis / Forecasting**
The Cost Analysis dashboard displays accumulated cost, budget line, and forecast trend.

### **4. Azure Advisor (Cost Section)**
Azure Advisor provides optimization recommendations.  
My account currently has **no cost recommendations**, which is expected for low/no usage.

## **Part 2 — Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

### **1. Billing Overview**
The GCP Billing dashboard includes total cost, forecast, and FinOps score.

### **2. Cost Reports**
The Reports page shows a breakdown of service usage and forecasted cost by month.

### **3. Budget Creation**
I created a **monthly $8 budget** using the Budgets & Alerts tool.

### **4. Budget Summary with 80% Threshold**
The final budget includes an **80% alert threshold**, triggering notifications at $6.40.

### **5. Cost Breakdown**
This report shows usage, credits, discounts, and overall cost impact.

---

### **6. FinOps Hub / Cost Optimization**
The FinOps Hub displays optimization insights and potential savings.  
There are no active recommendations, which is normal for new environments.

## **Conclusion**
Both Azure and GCP gave strong cost management tools, including alerting, forecasting, and optimization insights. Despite having no active recommendations due to minimal usage, the exercise reinforced how budget alerts and dashboards support cost control and transparency in cloud environments.
